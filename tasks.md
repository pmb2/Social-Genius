# Project Analysis: Social-Genius

## Objective
Analyze the Social-Genius project (React/Node.js social media tool) to understand its core features, database configuration, and user authentication. Document findings in `.agent-os/product/`.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Codebase Investigation

1.  **Core Features Identification:**
    *   Examined `app/` directory for React components related to posts, profiles, feeds, and user interactions. (Completed)
    *   Reviewed `services/` and `lib/` for backend logic corresponding to these features. (Completed)
    *   Looked for API routes in `app/api/`. (Completed)

2.  **Database Configuration Analysis:**
    *   Investigated `init-db.sql`, `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`, and `setup-database.js` for schema and initial data. (Completed)
    *   Examined `pg-` prefixed files (e.g., `pg-direct-client.js`, `pg-pool-fix.js`) for PostgreSQL connection and interaction patterns. (Completed)
    *   Checked `migrations/` for database evolution. (Completed)

3.  **User Authentication Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed `app/auth/` for authentication-related components and logic. (Completed)
    *   Examined `middleware.ts` for authentication middleware. (Completed)
    *   Looked into `create-test-user.js` for user creation patterns. (Completed)

### Phase 2: Documentation Generation

1.  **Create/Update `.agent-os/product/mission.md`:**
    *   Summarized the project's purpose and core functionalities. (Completed)

2.  **Create `.agent-os/product/core_features.md`:**
    *   Detailed the identified core features and their implementation overview. (Completed)

3.  **Create `.agent-os/product/database_config.md`:**
    *   Described the database setup, schema, and connection methods. (Completed)

4.  **Create `.agent-os/product/authentication.md`:**
    *   Explained the user authentication flow and mechanisms. (Completed)

### Phase 3: Verification
*   Ensured all required documentation files are created in the specified directory. (Completed)
*   Confirmed the content accurately reflects the codebase analysis. (Completed)

## Analysis Summary

The SocialGenius project is a React/Node.js application designed for social media management. It features robust user authentication (email/password and OAuth via NextAuth.js), comprehensive business profile management, and integration with various social media platforms. The backend utilizes PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for advanced data capabilities and includes custom fixes for `pg-pool` for stable database connections. The project structure is modular, with clear separation of concerns between frontend components, API routes, and database interactions. Security measures include password hashing and token encryption. The documentation in `.agent-os/product/` now provides a detailed overview of these aspects.
