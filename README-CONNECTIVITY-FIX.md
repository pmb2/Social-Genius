# Container Connectivity Fix Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix container connectivity issues between services in the Social Genius application, particularly focused on resolving the "Session cookie not found before adding business" error and ensuring reliable communication between the main app container, Redis, and the browser-use-api service for Google authentication.

## Key Changes

1. **Redis Connection Resilience**
   - Implemented advanced fallback mechanism with multiple connection URLs
   - Added dynamic connection retries with exponential backoff and jitter
   - Enhanced error diagnostics and DNS resolution diagnostics
   - Added PING validation for connection quality
   - Fixed "Session cookie not found" error when adding business profiles
   - Improved connection recovery after network interruptions

2. **Browser API Connectivity**
   - Created API URL fallback system with automatic failover between endpoints
   - Added connection retry with backoff for all API requests
   - Enhanced request headers with diagnostic information for better tracing
   - Improved connection handling with automatic recovery
   - Fixed session cookie propagation between services
   - Added more comprehensive health checks and ping tests

3. **Session Management Improvements**
   - Improved session cookie handling with direct header parsing
   - Enhanced user ID validation with recovery mechanisms
   - Fixed session extraction and verification
   - Added graceful degradation when sessions are invalid
   - Implemented session recovery in critical API routes
   - Added detailed logging for session-related errors

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improved error diagnostics with detailed context information
   - Added structured logging for connectivity issues
   - Enhanced retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Created graceful shutdown handlers to prevent connection leaks
   - Implemented proper error propagation across services
   - Added network diagnostics for common failure scenarios

5. **Documentation & Testing Tools**
   - Created comprehensive container connectivity troubleshooting guide
   - Added detailed error patterns and solutions documentation
   - Enhanced connectivity test script with detailed reporting
   - Documented Docker network configuration best practices
   - Added container health check script with service-specific tests

## Configuration Files Updated

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `src/lib/browser-automation/config.ts`
- `src/lib/browser-automation/index.ts`
- `src/services/compliance/redis-session-manager.ts`

## New Files Added

- `src/scripts/test-connectivity.mjs` - Tests all service connections
- `src/scripts/container-healthcheck.sh` - Runtime health check script
- `src/docs/CONTAINER_CONNECTIVITY.md` - Documentation for troubleshooting connectivity

## Running the Connection Test

```bash
# Test all container connections
npm run test:connectivity
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues, follow the steps in `src/docs/CONTAINER_CONNECTIVITY.md` or run the container health check script:

```bash
# Run the health check script
bash src/scripts/container-healthcheck.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the connections across different environments
2. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive monitoring for connection issues
3. **Optimization**: Enhance connection pooling and performance
4. **Resilience**: Further improve automatic reconnection and fallback mechanisms
