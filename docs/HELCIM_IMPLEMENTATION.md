# Helcim Payment Processor Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Helcim payment processor for Social Genius subscription system.

## Implementation Summary

We have implemented a comprehensive payment processing system using Helcim, including:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - `payment-service.ts` for interfacing with Helcim API
   - API routes for customers, subscriptions, and webhooks
   - Database schema for storing subscription data

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - Subscription selection interface
   - Payment form with validation
   - Subscription management page

3. **Documentation**:
   - `PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md` with detailed implementation plan
   - Updated README with subscription and payment info
   - `NEXTJS_BUILD_ISSUES.md` for tracking and resolving build issues

## Project Structure

Here's how the payment implementation is structured:

```
/services/
  payment-service.ts             - Core Helcim API integration

/app/api/payments/
  create-customer/route.ts       - API route for customer registration
  create-subscription/route.ts   - API route for new subscriptions
  update-subscription/route.ts   - API route for changing plans
  cancel-subscription/route.ts   - API route for cancelling subscriptions
  webhooks/route.ts              - Webhook handler for subscription events

/components/subscription/
  subscription-selector.tsx      - UI for selecting subscription plans
  payment-form.tsx               - Payment method collection form

/app/(protected)/subscription/
  page.tsx                       - Subscription management page

/lib/subscription/
  plans.ts                       - Subscription plan configuration

/docs/
  PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md         - Detailed implementation plan
  NEXTJS_BUILD_ISSUES.md         - Troubleshooting guide
```

## Database Schema

The subscription system uses the following database tables:

1. **subscription_plans**: Defines available subscription tiers
2. **payment_customers**: Stores customer payment information
3. **subscriptions**: Tracks active subscriptions
4. **payment_methods**: Manages tokenized payment methods
5. **payments**: Records payment transactions

Run the `subscription-db-update.sql` script to add these tables to your database.

## Environment Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
# Payment Processing with Helcim
HELCIM_API_KEY=your-helcim-api-key
HELCIM_ACCOUNT_ID=your-helcim-account-id
HELCIM_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
HELCIM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-helcim-webhook-secret
```

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Register with Helcim**:
   - Sign up for a merchant account
   - Obtain API keys and configure webhooks

2. **Deployment Steps**:
   - Run database migration script (`subscription-db-update.sql`)
   - Configure environment variables
   - Rebuild application containers

3. **Testing**:
   - Test payment flow using sandbox credentials
   - Verify webhook processing
   - Test subscription management (upgrades, downgrades, cancellations)

## Build Issues Resolution

We encountered and fixed several build issues:

1. **Missing fs module**:
   - Updated Next.js webpack config
   - Added browser polyfills

2. **Non-existent npm package**:
   - Removed `helcim-js-sdk` dependency
   - Implemented direct API calls using Axios

3. **Cache corruption**:
   - Documented cache clearing procedure
   - Added solution to build issues document

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to `/docs/NEXTJS_BUILD_ISSUES.md`.
