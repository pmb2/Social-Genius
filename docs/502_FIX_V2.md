# 502 Bad Gateway Fix - V2

This document explains the targeted approach to fix the 502 Bad Gateway error by deploying a maintenance page with minimal dependencies.

## Issues Identified

Based on the logs, we identified multiple issues:

1. **Build Error in Next.js Application**
   - Syntax error in `src/app/api/init-oauth-db/route.ts`
   - Error: `Expected unicode escape` on line 84: `if (\!fs.existsSync(migrationPath)) {`
   - The backslash before the exclamation mark is causing a parsing error

2. **Port Conflict**
   - Port 80 is already in use by another service
   - Error: "failed to bind host port for 0.0.0.0:80:172.18.0.2:80/tcp: address already in use"

3. **Missing Server File**
   - The app container can't find `/app/plain-server.js`
   - Error: "Cannot find module '/app/plain-server.js'"

4. **Docker Networking Issues**
   - Orphan containers and conflicting networks

## Solution Strategy

Our approach is to deploy a simple maintenance page while we fix the underlying Next.js application:

1. **Create a Minimal Server**
   - Simple Node.js HTTP server without Express or Next.js dependencies
   - Serves a maintenance page for all routes
   - Properly responds to health checks for the load balancer

2. **Simplified Docker Setup**
   - Minimal Dockerfile that only needs Node.js
   - No build step required, eliminating the risk of build errors
   - Use port 8080 instead of 80 to avoid conflicts

3. **Basic Nginx Configuration**
   - Simple, reliable proxy configuration
   - Forwards traffic to the maintenance page
   - Properly handles health checks

4. **Thorough Cleanup**
   - Stop and remove all existing containers
   - Kill processes using conflicting ports
   - Clean up Docker networks

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix-502-v2.sh
   ```

2. Verify the maintenance page is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl localhost:8080
   curl localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. Check that app.social-genius.com shows the maintenance page

## Next Steps After Restoration

1. **Fix the Next.js Build Error**
   - Remove the backslash before the exclamation mark in init-oauth-db/route.ts
   - Verify there are no other syntax errors in the codebase

2. **Update Docker Configuration**
   - Ensure the proper port bindings (use 8080:80 if port 80 is in use)
   - Configure the Next.js server to bind to 0.0.0.0

3. **Fix Server Implementation**
   - Ensure the plain-server.js file is properly included in the container
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery

4. **Rebuild and Deploy**
   - Once the issues are fixed, rebuild the application
   - Deploy using the regular deployment process

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Restoration**
   - Gets a working website back online quickly
   - Maintains proper health check responses for the load balancer

2. **Minimal Dependencies**
   - No complex libraries or frameworks that could fail
   - Simple Node.js HTTP server with no build step

3. **Diagnostic Information**
   - Provides detailed logs to help diagnose the underlying issues
   - Clear error messages and status information

4. **User Communication**
   - Shows a professional maintenance page instead of an error
   - Sets proper expectations for users

This solution is designed to get your site back online quickly with a maintenance page while you fix the underlying issues with the Next.js application.
