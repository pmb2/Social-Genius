# Security Improvements

## Password Storage and Authentication

### Issues Fixed

1. **Inconsistent Password Hashing**: The application had inconsistencies between how passwords were hashed during registration and how they were verified during login, leading to authentication failures.

2. **Plaintext Password Transmission**: Passwords were sometimes transmitted in plaintext or with minimal protection in request bodies and URLs, making them vulnerable to interception.

3. **Insecure HTTP Usage**: The application allowed sensitive operations over unencrypted HTTP connections.

### Improvements

1. **Consistent Password Hashing**:
   - Fixed the backend authentication service to properly store and verify password hashes
   - Ensured the same hashing algorithms are used consistently in both registration and login processes
   - Added fallback mechanisms to support multiple hash formats for backward compatibility

2. **Secure Credential Handling**:
   - Created a dedicated secure credential handling service (`secure-credential-handler.ts`)
   - Implemented client-side password hashing using Web Crypto API with PBKDF2
   - Removed any instances of plaintext password transmission
   - Added timestamp-based protection against replay attacks

3. **Connection Security**:
   - Enforced HTTPS for all sensitive operations in production
   - Added automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - Implemented proper security headers (HSTS, Content-Type Options, XSS Protection, etc.)
   - Added connection security checks in authentication forms

4. **Authentication Flow Improvements**:
   - Added stronger password validation with complexity requirements
   - Implemented more detailed error reporting for security-related issues
   - Added secure fallbacks for environments where Web Crypto API is not available

## Database Reset

To address existing passwords that were stored with the previous inconsistent approach, we created tools to reset the user database:

1. **Reset Script**: Use `/reset-database.sh` to completely reset all users and related data in the database, allowing for clean registration with the new secure password handling.

2. **Node.js Script**: For non-Docker environments, use `node scripts/reset-users.js` to perform the same operation.

**Warning**: These scripts will delete all user data including sessions, businesses, and related records. Use with caution and only when necessary.

## Usage

### Resetting the Database

```bash
# Using the Docker-based script
./reset-database.sh

# OR using Node.js directly
node scripts/reset-users.js
```

### Security Best Practices

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Regularly rotate encryption keys and passwords
3. Monitor for suspicious login attempts
4. Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
