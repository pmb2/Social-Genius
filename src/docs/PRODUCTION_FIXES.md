# Production Build Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to make the application deployable in a production environment.

## Database Connection Handling

The application now has robust database connection handling that:

1. Gracefully handles database connection failures during build time
2. Implements proper connection pooling with automatic retry logic
3. Uses connection timeouts to prevent hanging the build process
4. Implements exponential backoff with jitter for connection retries
5. Provides detailed logging for connection issues

## API Route Configuration

All API routes are now configured with:

1. `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to ensure they are never statically generated
2. `revalidate = 0` to prevent caching
3. `runtime = 'nodejs'` to specify the Node.js runtime

This ensures that routes requiring access to:
- Request headers
- Request cookies
- Request URL
- Other request-specific data

Are properly handled at runtime rather than build time.

## Next.js Configuration

The Next.js configuration was updated with:

1. Proper webpack fallbacks for Node.js built-in modules
2. Enhanced experimental options for server components
3. Production-ready header configurations
4. Optimized build settings
5. Custom build scripts for production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

To build the application for deployment:

```bash
# Use the production build script that includes optimizations
npm run build:deploy
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `.next` directory.

For deployment, use:

```bash
npm start
```

## Runtime Database Configuration

In production, make sure to set the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
DATABASE_URL_DOCKER=postgresql://username:password@postgres:5432/database
```

The application will automatically try multiple connection strings if the primary one fails.
