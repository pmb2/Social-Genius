# Google Auth Implementation Tasks

This is a focused task list to implement the core Google Business Profile authentication flow as quickly as possible. These tasks are prioritized to get the basic authentication working first, with refinements to follow.

## 1. Frontend Components

- [ ] Add Google login form to compliance tab/business creation modal
  - Simple email and password inputs with validation
  - Add loading state indicator during authentication
  - Implement basic error message display
- [ ] Set up authentication API call with proper parameters
- [ ] Implement status polling mechanism to check auth task progress
- [ ] Add success/failure UI states based on authentication result

## 2. API Endpoints

- [ ] Create `/api/compliance/auth` endpoint to handle authentication requests
  - Accept business ID, email, and password
  - Validate user session and permissions
  - Forward credentials to browser automation service
  - Return task ID for status tracking
- [ ] Create `/api/compliance/task-status` endpoint
  - Accept task ID and return current status
  - Include error details if authentication failed

## 3. Browser Automation Service

- [ ] Ensure browser-use-api container is working properly
- [ ] Implement Google login automation sequence
  - Navigate to Google login page
  - Enter email and password
  - Handle basic error scenarios (wrong password, etc.)
  - Capture screenshots at key points for debugging
- [ ] Add session cookie extraction and storage
- [ ] Implement basic error detection and classification

## 4. Integration & Storage

- [ ] Create session storage mechanism for Google credentials
- [ ] Implement cookie persistence for maintaining Google login
- [ ] Set up basic business profile data extraction after successful login
- [ ] Add method to validate saved sessions are still valid

## 5. Testing & Debugging

- [ ] Add trace ID generation for tracking requests through the system
- [ ] Implement basic logging at key points in the process
- [ ] Create test account for Google authentication
- [ ] Add screenshots for successful and failed authentication attempts

## 6. Minimal Deployment & Verification

- [ ] Test the full authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify session persistence works across browser restarts
- [ ] Confirm basic business profile data is retrieved
- [ ] Document common error cases and solutions

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Enhance error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Improve security measures for credential handling
- [ ] Add metrics for authentication success/failure rates
- [ ] Implement more comprehensive logging
- [ ] Optimize performance for browser automation
- [ ] Add support for 2FA and other advanced authentication scenarios
