   - Added session restoration after browser crashes
   - Implemented cross-service session sharing

3. **Error Handling Infrastructure**
   - Created comprehensive error classification system
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Added user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
   
4. **Redis Integration**
   - Added Redis to Docker Compose configurations
   - Implemented distributed locking for concurrent access
   - Created browser profile state synchronization

5. **Browser-Based Authentication Flow**
   - Implemented structured login sequence with step-by-step stages
   - Added challenge detection for 2FA, captcha, and verification requests
   - Implemented human-like interaction patterns (variable typing speed, natural mouse movements)
   - Added screenshot capture for diagnostics
   - Created Login Manager for integrated Redis session handling

### In Progress
1. **Profile Data Scraping System**
   - Need to develop DOM parsing utilities for extracting business data
