# SocialGenius Project Mission

SocialGenius is a social media management tool designed to help users manage their business profiles and social media presence across various platforms. It provides features for:

*   **Business Profile Management:** Users can create and manage multiple business profiles, track their compliance status, and view key metrics.
*   **Social Account Integration:** Seamlessly connect and manage social media accounts (e.g., X/Twitter, Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) for each business profile.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using email/password and OAuth (NextAuth.js) with session management.
*   **Data Storage & Retrieval:** Utilizes PostgreSQL for robust data storage, including user data, business profiles, social account details, and potentially vectorized content for advanced features (e.g., memories, document analysis).
*   **Subscription Management:** Supports different subscription tiers with varying limits on features like the number of business locations.

The primary goal of SocialGenius is to provide a comprehensive and intuitive platform for businesses to streamline their social media operations and enhance their online presence.
